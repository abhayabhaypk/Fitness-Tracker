# Blueprint: Cross-Platform Fitness Tracker

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for building a cross-platform fitness tracker app using Flutter. The app will leverage device sensors to monitor user activities and display animated progress visualizations to keep users motivated.

## Features

- **Step Tracking:** Monitor the user's daily steps using the device's built-in pedometer.
- **Activity Monitoring:** Track different user activities, such as walking, running, and cycling.
- **Progress Visualization:** Display animated circular progress indicators to visualize the user's progress toward their fitness goals.
- **Goal Setting:** Allow users to set daily fitness goals and track their performance.
- **History:** Store and display the user's activity history to help them track their progress over time.
- **Cross-Platform:** The app will be available on both Android and iOS devices.
- **User Profile:** A dedicated screen for users to view and edit their profile information, including their name, email, and profile picture.

## Tech Stack

- **Flutter:** The app will be built using the Flutter framework for cross-platform development.
- **Pedometer:** The `pedometer` package will be used to access the device's step-tracking sensor.
- **Permission Handler:** The `permission_handler` package will be used to request the necessary permissions for accessing sensor data.
- **Circular Progress Indicators:** Animated circular progress indicators will be used to visualize the user's progress.

## UI/UX

The app will have a clean and modern design with a focus on user experience. The main screen will display the user's current activity, progress toward their fitness goals, and a summary of their daily performance. The UI will be designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with clear calls to action and a consistent design language.

## Action Plan

1. **Update `pubspec.yaml`:** Add the `pedometer` and `permission_handler` dependencies.
2. **Request Permissions:**
   - **Android:** Add the `ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION` permission to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
   - **iOS:** Add the `NSMotionUsageDescription` to `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
3. **UI Development:** Create the main screen with a circular progress indicator and a text widget to display the step count.
4. **Sensor Integration:**
   - Use the `permission_handler` package to request the necessary permissions.
   - Use the `pedometer` package to track the user's steps.
5. **State Management:** Use a `StreamBuilder` to listen for updates from the pedometer and update the UI accordingly.
6. **Testing:** Test the app on both Android and iOS devices to ensure that it works as expected.
7. **Profile Screen:** Create a new screen that allows users to view and edit their profile information.
